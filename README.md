# School_District_Analysis
My analysis on the school’s district Data.

## Overview of Project
	The data provided to me in a csv file, represents a 	raw information of 15 charter and high schools combined. 

### Purpose
	To help Maria to simply understand the provided data, and 	giving her elements to make the right decision on how to make the school budget for next school year based on the current results 
## Analysis and Challenges
	Many padas functions didn't work well when running my code until I've 	updated my material version.

### The impact of the academic dishonesty that happened at Thomas High school.
•	Per student budget: the $638 budget allocated per student haven’t changed after we commit changes, because in accounting this called fixes charges(not variable charges) the students still consumed their budget with or without academic results and this have nothing to deal with good or bad results.
•	Passing math score (Thomas High School): changed from 93.27% to 66.91% after the changes, and this means that results were altered.
•	Passing reading score (Thomas High School): changed from 97.3% to 69.66% after the changes, and this means that results were altered.
•	Overall passing (Thomas High school): changed from 90.94% to 65.08% after the changes, and this means that results were altered.
•	Passing Math (charter school): changed from 94% to 90% after the changes, the academic dishonest affected the passing math on charter schools by reducing their passing math score by 4%
•	Passing reading (charter school): changed from 97% to 93% after the changes, the academic dishonesty affected the passing reading on charter schools by reducing their passing reading score by 4%
•	Overall passing (charter schools): changed from 90% to 87% after the changes, the academic dishonesty affected the overall passing scores on charter schools by reducing their total passing score by 3%
•	Overall passing (district schools): the district schools were not affected by the changes to Thomas High School and this is due to Thomas High School is a charter school
### Major changes to the school district analysis after reading and math scores have been replaced, all of Thomas High School:
passing math percentage, passing reading percentage, passing overall percentage and passing score percentage on charter schools have been changed from a high to low percentage.
